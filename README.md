### About Me
Hi, I'm Samuel and I'm a Year 12 student in England.  

Since 2019 I have been taking part in the UK Government's [Cyber Discovery Program](https://joincyberdiscovery.com). In my first year (2019-20), I placed in the top 240 out of over 35000 participants and qualified for the final CyberStart Elite phase. As part of this, I studied Ethical Hacking Fundamentals, an adapted version of the [SEC560](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/network-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking/) course.
